# Task 3: Joint Embedding

Learning of an embedded space that leverages the information of multiple modalities (e.g. for improved cell type annotation).

## Summary

The functioning of organs, tissues, and whole organisms is determined by the interplay of cells. Cells are characterised into broad types, which in turn can take on different states. Here, a cell state is made up of the sum of all processes that are occurring within the cell. We can gain insight into the state of a cell by different types of measurements: e.g., RNA expression, protein abundance, or chromatin conformation. Combining this information to describe cellular heterogeneity requires the formation of joint embeddings generated from this multimodal data. These embeddings must account for and remove possible batch effects between different measurement batches. The reward for methods that can achieve this is great: a highly resolved description of the underlying biological state of a cell that determines its function, how it interacts with other cells, and thus the cellâ€™s role in the functioning of the whole tissue.

## Component API

### Dataset censor component

A component that censors an input datasets to the task-specific format. It expects two h5ad files containing the paired single-cell profiles using two different modalities (e.g. RNA and ADT). 

#### Input data formats

This component expects two h5ad files, `--input_mod1` and `--input_mod2`. They both contain the attributes below. If the `feature_types` of one file is `"GEX"`, then that of the other must be either `"ATAC"` or `"ADT"`.

  * `.X`: Sparse profile matrix.
  * `.obs['batch']`: Batch id.
  * `.obs['size_factors']`: The size factors computed by scran.
  * `.obs['cell_type']`: Cell type each cell belongs to.
  * `.obs['organism']`: Organism the cell was taken from (only for `"GEX"` features).
  * `.obs['S_score']`: Cell cycle score on S-phase genes (only for `"GEX"` features). Required if `var_names` are not gene symbols.
